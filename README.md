** What's that: **
Helps us to create a Dockerized Symfony application

# HOW TO USE IT: 

Easy
1. Clonate the repro
`git clone git@github.com:AntonioFerrerLopez/SymfonyDockerCreator.git`

2. Modify the environment variables from the .env file to suit your needs

3. REMEMBER TO ADD THE .env FILE TO GITIGNORE if you think it is necessary (for security reasons). I have left it as a sample

4.Create the application using the command:
`./createSymfonyApp.sh` 

5. Enjoy :satisfied:

6. If it has been useful, give me a :star: that costs nothing :heart:

CONTRIBUTIONS: 

This work was born to automate a task that repeated a lot, then I saw that it could be useful to more people and I decided to upload it.
If you want to contribute any ideas or make modifications, you are completely free to do.
